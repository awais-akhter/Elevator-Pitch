Hello, I'm Ali Amanat Ali, a final-year Computer Sciences student at PUCIT graduating in July. 
With a year of hands-on experience as a full-stack developer, 
I've passionately crafted applications for clients. Last summer, 
I further honed my skills through a MERN Stack internship at Devsinc.

Beyond my technical expertise, I've held leadership roles as the President of the Media Society at my university. 
Excelling academically and professionally, I've also served as an ambassador for Tkxel and Devsinc, 
emphasizing my dedication to bridging the gap between academia and industry.
